Abstract:
Valley Children’s Hospital (VCH) is a children’s teaching hospital located in Madera County, California. With the events of the pandemic, motivations towards telemedicine increased and the prospect of Virtual Reality (VR) examinations has been in fruition.The team developed a VR environment and a front-end in which a doctor can proctor a neurological exam for patients with a brain injury, such as a stroke. This exam would extract data in order to classify strength levels of the patient, as well as, provide insight for a doctor’s diagnosis. The front-end will allow the doctor to view exam information as well as generate a report on the exam results.
