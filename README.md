"# CSE-120-Fall-2022---VCH" 

Abstract:
Valley Children’s Hospital (VCH) is a healthcare institution located in the central valley of California, providing excellent healthcare services to children. In order to enhance the VCH’s virtual medicine services, this project explores the use of Virtual Reality (VR) to track movement during neurological examinations for more accuracy. The team developed a VR environment and a front-end, in which a doctor can proctor a neurological exam for patients with a brain injury, such as a stroke. This exam would track the patient’s elbow flexion/extension, and extract that positional data to compute the angular velocity and create a classification of strength based on the angular velocity achieved. The purpose of this is to hasten the evaluation of the injuries sustained by the patient along key points on their spinal cord. The front-end will allow the doctor to view exam information, along with generating a report on the exam results.
